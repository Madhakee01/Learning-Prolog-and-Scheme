# Learning-Prolog-and-Scheme
Learning Prolog and Scheme languages for my COMP 4400 Principles of Programming Course with Dr. Jessica Chen. One of the best and challenging profs I ever had... love her. 

This Repo will consist of any resources, notes and sample program that i do in the learning process. Feel free to make use of it, if anything is wrong or have any questions... feel free to reach out to me.
